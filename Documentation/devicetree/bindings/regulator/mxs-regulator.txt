Regulators for Freescale MX23/MX28

Required properties:
For imx23 regulators
- compatible:
  - "fsl,imx23-vddd" for VDDD
  - "fsl,imx23-vdda" for VDDA
  - "fsl,imx23-vddio" for VDDIO
For imx28 regulators
- compatible:
  - "fsl,imx28-vddd" for VDDD
  - "fsl,imx28-vdda" for VDDA
  - "fsl,imx28-vddio" for VDDIO
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
  the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
  - "base-address"	- contains base address of regulator
  - "v5ctrl-address"	- contains 5V control address of power subsystem
  - "status-address"	- contains status address of power subsystem
  

Any regulator property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.

Example for imx28:

	reg_vddd: regulator@80044040 {
		reg = <0x80044040 0x10>,
		      <0x80044010 0x10>,
		      <0x800440c0 0x10>;
		reg-names = "base-address",
			    "v5ctrl-address",
			    "status-address";
		compatible = "fsl,imx28-vddd";
		regulator-name = "vddd";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1350000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1550000>;
		regulator-always-on;					
		regulator-boot-on;
		vddd-supply = <&reg_vdda>;
	};

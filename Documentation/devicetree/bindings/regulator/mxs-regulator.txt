MXS regulators

Required node properties:
- compatible: Should be "simple-bus"
- #address-cells: Number of cells required to define regulator register, 
  must be 1
- #size-cells: Number of cells required to define register size, must be 1
- reg: Absolute physical address and size of the register set for the device

Required regulator properties:
- compatible: Must be "fsl,mxs-regulator"
- reg: Absolute physical address of the register set for the regulator

Any regulator property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.

Example:

	power: power@80044000 {
		compatible = "simple-bus";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x80044000 0x2000>;
		ranges;

		reg_vddd: regulator@80044040 {
			reg = <0x80044040 0x10>;
			compatible = "fsl,mxs-regulator";
			regulator-name = "vddd";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <800000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1575000>;
			regulator-boot-on;
			vddd-supply = <&reg_vdda>;
		};
	};

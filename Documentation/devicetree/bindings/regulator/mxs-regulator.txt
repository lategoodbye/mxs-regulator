MXS regulators

Required node properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,<soc>-power", where soc is "imx23" or "imx28"
- #address-cells: Number of cells required to define regulator register, 
  must be 1
- #size-cells: Must be zero
- reg: Absolute physical address and length of the register set for the device

Required regulator properties:
- compatible: Must be "fsl,mxs-regulator"
- reg: Absolute physical address of the register set for the regulator

Any regulator property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.

Example:

	power: power@80044000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx28-power";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x80044000 0x2000>;

		reg_vddio: regulator-vddio@80044060 {
			reg = <0x80044060>;
			compatible = "fsl,mxs-regulator";
			regulator-name = "vddio";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <2800000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3600000>;
			regulator-microvolt-offset = <80000>;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};
	};
